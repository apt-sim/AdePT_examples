# AdePT Examples

This directory contains all standalone examples for the AdePT project.
Each example lives in its own subdirectory:

    examples/<example-name>/

Every example includes:
- its own source files,
- a dedicated `CMakeLists.txt`, and
- a `README.md` describing how to build and run it.

For the full list of available examples and detailed documentation, see:

- `../docs/README.md` — Example overview & index  
- `../docs/example_template.md` — Template for creating new examples

When adding a new example, create a new subdirectory under `examples/` and
document it using the provided template.
