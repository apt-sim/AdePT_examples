# AdePT Examples

This repository hosts standalone examples for
[AdePT](https://github.com/apt-sim/AdePT).  
Its goals are to:

- provide minimal and focused demonstrations of AdePT features,
- offer templates for integrating AdePT into custom applications,
- serve as a basis for validation and sanity checks in continuous integration.

---

## 📚 Documentation

Documentation for all examples is located in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.

- **Overview & Example Index:**  
  👉 [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)

- **Template for creating a new example:**  
  👉 [`docs/example_template.md`](docs/example_template.md)

Each example under [`examples/`](examples/) contains its own `README.md` based on
this template.

## 🔧 Build Instructions

The examples assume an existing AdePT installation (and its dependencies).  
In a typical setup:

1. Install AdePT as described in the AdePT [README](https://github.com/apt-sim/AdePT).  
2. Configure this repository with CMake, pointing `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the AdePT installation:

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path_to_adept_installation>;<other_prefixes>"

   cmake --build build -- -j
   ```

Individual example targets will appear under `build/examples/<name>/`.

For details, follow the documentation of each example.
